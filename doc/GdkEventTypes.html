<p>Do not confuse these events with the signals that GTK+ widgets emit. Although many of these events result in corresponding signals being emitted, the events are often transformed or filtered along the way.</p>
<p>In some language bindings, the values GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS and GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS would translate into something syntactically invalid (eg Gdk.EventType.2ButtonPress, where a symbol is not allowed to start with a number). In that case, the aliases GDK_DOUBLE_BUTTON_PRESS and GDK_TRIPLE_BUTTON_PRESS can be used instead.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="class_GdkEventButton"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">class GdkEventButton</a></h2>
<p>Used for mouse button press and button release events. The type will be one of GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS or GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE,</p>
<p>Double and triple-clicks result in a sequence of events being received. For double-clicks the order of events will be: GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE, GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS and GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE.</p>
<p>Note that the first click is received just like a normal button press, while the second click results in a GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS being received just after the GDK_BUTTON_PRESS.</p>
<p>Triple-clicks are very similar to double-clicks, except that GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS is inserted after the third click. The order of the events is: GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE, GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE, GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS and GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE.</p>
<p>For a double click to occur, the second button press must occur within 1/4 of a second of the first. For a triple click to occur, the third button press must also occur within 1/2 second of the first button press.</p>
<p>To handle e.g. a triple mouse button presses, all events can be ignored except GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS</p>

<p>Touch events are grouped into sequences by means of the sequence field, which can also be obtained with gdk_event_get_event_sequence(). Each sequence begins with a GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN event, followed by any number of GDK_TOUCH_UPDATE events, and ends with a GDK_TOUCH_END (or GDK_TOUCH_CANCEL) event. With multitouch devices, there may be several active sequences at the same time.</p>
