=head1 Enums, Structs and Unions

=head2 Enum GdkEventType
Specifies the type of the event.

Do not confuse these events with the signals that GTK+ widgets emit. Although many of these events result in corresponding signals being emitted, the events are often transformed or filtered along the way.

In some language bindings, the values GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS and GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS would translate into something syntactically invalid (eg Gdk.EventType.2ButtonPress, where a symbol is not allowed to start with a number). In that case, the aliases GDK_DOUBLE_BUTTON_PRESS and GDK_TRIPLE_BUTTON_PRESS can be used instead.

=item GDK_NOTHING; a special code to indicate a null event.
=item GDK_DELETE; the window manager has requested that the toplevel window be hidden or destroyed, usually when the user clicks on a special icon in the title bar.
=item GDK_DESTROY; the window has been destroyed.
=item GDK_EXPOSE; all or part of the window has become visible and needs to be redrawn.
=item GDK_MOTION_NOTIFY; the pointer (usually a mouse) has moved.
=item GDK_BUTTON_PRESS; a mouse button has been pressed.
=item GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS; a mouse button has been double-clicked (clicked twice within a short period of time). Note that each click also generates a GDK_BUTTON_PRESS event.
=item GDK_DOUBLE_BUTTON_PRESS; alias for GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS, added in 3.6.
=item GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS; a mouse button has been clicked 3 times in a short period of time. Note that each click also generates a GDK_BUTTON_PRESS event.
=item GDK_TRIPLE_BUTTON_PRESS; alias for GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS, added in 3.6.
=item GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE; a mouse button has been released.
=item GDK_KEY_PRESS; a key has been pressed.
=item GDK_KEY_RELEASE; a key has been released.
=item GDK_ENTER_NOTIFY; the pointer has entered the window.
=item GDK_LEAVE_NOTIFY; the pointer has left the window.
=item GDK_FOCUS_CHANGE; the keyboard focus has entered or left the window.
=item GDK_CONFIGURE; the size, position or stacking order of the window has changed. Note that GTK+ discards these events for GDK_WINDOW_CHILD windows.

Contains the fields which are common to all event classes. This comes in handy to check its type for instance.

=item GdkEventType $.type; the type of the event.

Describes a key press or key release event. The type of the event will be one of GDK_KEY_PRESS or GDK_KEY_RELEASE.

=item GdkEventType $.type
=item GTK::V3::Gdk::GdkWindow $.window
=item Int $.send_event
=item UInt $.time; the time of the event in milliseconds.
=item UInt $.state; a bit-mask representing the state of the modifier keys (e.g. Control, Shift and Alt) and the pointer buttons. See GdkModifierType.	[type GdkModifierType].
=item UInt $.keyval; the key that was pressed or released. See the gdk/gdkkeysyms.h header file for a complete list of GDK key codes.
=item Int $.length; the length of string.
=item Str $.string;  deprecated.
=item UInt $.hardware_keycode; the raw code of the key that was pressed or released.

=head2 class GdkEventButton

Used for mouse button press and button release events. The type will be one of GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS or GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE,

Double and triple-clicks result in a sequence of events being received. For double-clicks the order of events will be: GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE, GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS and GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE.

Note that the first click is received just like a normal button press, while the second click results in a GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS being received just after the GDK_BUTTON_PRESS.

Triple-clicks are very similar to double-clicks, except that GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS is inserted after the third click. The order of the events is: GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE, GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE, GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS and  GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE.

For a double click to occur, the second button press must occur within 1/4 of a second of the first. For a triple click to occur, the third button press must also occur within 1/2 second of the first button press.

To handle e.g. a triple mouse button presses, all events can be ignored except GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS

  method handle-keypress ( :$widget, GdkEventButton :$event ) {
    # check if left mouse button was pressed three times
    if $event.type ~~ GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS and $event.button == 1 {

=item GdkEventType $.type;
=item GTK::V3::Gdk::GdkWindow $.window;
=item Int $.send_event;
=item UInt $.time; the time of the event in milliseconds.
=item Num $.x; the x coordinate of the pointer relative to the window.
=item Num $.y; the y coordinate of the pointer relative to the window.
=item Pointer[Num] $.axes; x , y translated to the axes of device , or NULL if device is the mouse.
=item UInt $.state; a bit-mask representing the state of the modifier keys (e.g. Control, Shift and Alt) and the pointer buttons. See GdkModifierType. [type GdkModifierType]
=item UInt $.button; the button which was pressed or released, numbered from 1 to 5. Normally button 1 is the left mouse button, 2 is the middle button, and 3 is the right button. On 2-button mice, the middle button can often be simulated by pressing both mouse buttons together.
=item GTK::V3::Gdk::GdkDevice $.device; the master device that the event originated from. Use gdk_event_get_source_device() to get the slave device.
=item Num $.x_root; the x coordinate of the pointer relative to the root of the screen.
=item Num $.y_root; the y coordinate of the pointer relative to the root of the screen.
